This is a simple flash card program written in PHP.  Card data is stored in 
CSV files.  The user has the option of viewing only the front of cards, only 
the back, randomly front or back, and being presented with cards in a random 
or in a sequential order.  The user can flag missed cards for further study.  
The goal of this project is simple implementation, a small set of features that
are very useful for studying, especially language study, and very fast 
flipping of cards over the Internet.
